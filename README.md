Solicited unsolicited advice from Kevin Kelly, served one at a time.

## Running locally
You'll need something like [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server#installation) to allow the cross-origin resources to load:

`live-server`

Making style changes? You'll need [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) installed. Then run:

`sass --watch css/sass/index.scss css/style.css`
